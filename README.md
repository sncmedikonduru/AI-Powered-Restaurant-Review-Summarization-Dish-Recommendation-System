# FlavorFinderAI 🍽️ – AI-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System

## 🚀 Project Overview
FlavorFinderAI is an **AI-driven restaurant recommendation system** that leverages **GPT-Neo for text generation** and **BERT embeddings for intelligent restaurant matching**. This project processes **real-world Yelp data** to provide **personalized dining suggestions** based on location, cuisine preferences, and customer review sentiment.

By integrating **state-of-the-art deep learning models**, this system showcases **advanced NLP techniques, AI-driven recommendations, and real-world data applications**.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
✅ **AI-Powered Recommendations** – Uses **BERT embeddings** for restaurant matching and **GPT-Neo for natural language responses**.  
✅ **Real-World Data Processing** – Analyzes **Yelp business & review dataset** (Find dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) to generate intelligent suggestions.  
✅ **Semantic Search with Deep Learning** – Enhances restaurant retrieval using **vectorized text representations**.  
✅ **Scalable & Customizable** – Designed for future integration with **chatbots & real-time location-based recommendations**.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: GPT-Neo (EleutherAI), BERT embeddings  
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, numpy, transformers, torch)  
- **NLP Processing**: Tokenization, embeddings, cosine similarity  
- **Data Handling**: Yelp dataset, JSON, pandas  
- **Machine Learning**: AI-driven restaurant recommendations  

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers pandas numpy sentence-transformers
   ```
3. Load the Yelp dataset and run the Jupyter Notebook step by step.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- 🤖 **Fine-Tuned GPT-Neo** for more human-like restaurant dialogue.  
- 🔍 **Sentiment-Based Filtering** using advanced BERT-based models.  
- 📍 **Real-Time AI Recommendations** based on user location & dining habits.  

## 💼 Why This Matters for Startups & Hiring Managers
This project **demonstrates expertise in AI, NLP, and deep learning**, showcasing:  
✅ **Large Language Models (GPT-Neo) for personalized recommendations**  
✅ **BERT embeddings for semantic similarity & restaurant ranking**  
✅ **Real-world dataset processing & AI-driven decision-making**  
✅ **Scalable ML models applicable to commercial recommendation engines**
